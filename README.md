#Model 1-

Description-

This is a Computer Vision project, using roboflow for annotations and creation of dataset
https://roboflow.com/

We take this dataset and then use YOLOv8 to train a custom model using our custom dataset
https://docs.ultralytics.com/

This will give us predictions that we can check in the deploy section of roboflow.
